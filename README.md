# xampro-selenium-testing-js

This project is a JavaScript-based Selenium testing suite for automated testing of a web applicationâ€™s functionality, primarily focusing on user authentication and profile management.

## Overview

This repository contains automated tests for essential user operations such as registration, login, and profile update. Built using Selenium, the tests simulate user interactions to validate key functionalities, ensuring the stability and reliability of the application.

## Project Structure

The following key files and folders are included:

- **`node_modules/`**: Directory for Node.js modules required for the project.
- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored in version control.
- **`Registration.js`**: Test file for the user registration process.
- **`login.js`**: Test file for the user login process.
- **`updateProfile.js`**: Test file for updating user profile information.
- **`userData.json`**: Stores user data used in various tests.
- **`package.json`**: Lists dependencies and scripts for the project.
- **`package-lock.json`**: Locks the versions of project dependencies.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MUMTAHINA-766/xampro-selenium-testing-js.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd xampro-selenium-testing-js
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To execute the tests, ensure that Selenium WebDriver is configured correctly and then run the following command:

```bash
node <test-file>.js
```

Replace `<test-file>` with the specific file name (e.g., `Registration.js` or `login.js`) to run the corresponding test.

## Future Enhancements

- Extend test coverage for additional functionalities.
- Integrate reporting tools for better test result analysis.
- Implement CI/CD pipeline for continuous testing.
